# DataScienceChallenges

This is a collection of all the challenges that I will take in order to learn and grasp all the concepts in the areas of Machine and Deep Learning. 

## Classification Challenges:

### Horses Health:
https://github.com/XaviRS95/DataScienceChallenges/tree/main/Classification/Horses-Health

Categorical competition from Kaggle. You have to predict the outcome of a horse (lived, died or euthanized) using the provided dataset using f1-score. 
The URL for this challenge is: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22
Additional data was used for the challenge from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/horse-survival-dataset

### Loan Challenge:
https://github.com/XaviRS95/DataScienceChallenges/tree/main/Classification/Loan-Challenge

Binary classification competition from Hacker Earth where you need to find out if a bank client that asked for a loan will default it or not. For this, a dataset of 600k+ rows is provided and roc-accuracy was the metric used to determine the winner.
