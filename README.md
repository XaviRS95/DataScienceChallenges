# Machine Learning Challenges

This is a collection of all the challenges that I will take in order to learn and grasp all the concepts in the areas of Machine and Deep Learning. 

## Classification Challenges:

### Horses Health:
Categorical competition from Kaggle. You have to predict the outcome of a horse (lived, died or euthanized) using the provided dataset using f1-score. 
[Original Horses Health Kaggle Challenge][1]<br/>
Additional data from the original dataset of the challenge was also included to improve the model's performance [Original horses data][2]<br/>
My implementation can be found [here][3]


### Loan Challenge:
https://github.com/XaviRS95/DataScienceChallenges/tree/main/Classification/Loan-Challenge
Binary classification competition from Hacker Earth where you need to find out if a bank client that asked for a loan will default it or not. For this, a dataset of 600k+ rows is provided and roc-accuracy was the metric used to determine the winner.
